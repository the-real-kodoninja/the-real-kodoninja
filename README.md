# 🚀 Minimalist. Builder. Trader. Ghost (maybe).

Hey, I’m **Emmanuel**—an introvert who’s outspoken, a creator who vanishes, and a developer who never stops building.  
I **code, trade, invest, and train** like I’m prepping for the Olympics. If you stare at me too long, I might do something weird.  

I thrive on **learning, challenging myself, and practicing stoicism**.  

- 🏢 Founded **Aviyon** in college.  
- 💰 Sold my first platform in high school, then more in college.  
- 🌐 Created **Kodoninja & the Kodoverse**, plus several social networks you’ve probably never heard of.  
- 🔧 Developed countless platforms and projects.  

Possibly the **most interesting boring person** you’ll ever meet.  
Currently diving back into **freelancing** while refining **[Kodoninja.app](https://kodoninja.app)**—a DeFi project running on **Motoko**, soon evolving into **KodoCoin** (but not yet, still polishing).
